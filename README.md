# Data Science Internship Task at Codsoft

## Project Overview
TASK 1 TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
Project Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction model is designed to predict the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the RMS Titanic based on historical data. 
This data-driven analysis helps to understand the factors influencing survival rates and apply machine learning techniques to predict survival outcomes for new data.

TASK 3 IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION 
Project Overview
The Iris Flower Classification project aims to classify iris flowers into three species based on their physical measurements.
This project serves as an introductory exercise in machine learning and data analysis, utilizing the Iris datasetâ€”a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning.

TASK 4 SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
The Sales Prediction project aims to forecast future sales based on historical sales data and other relevant features.
Accurate sales forecasting helps businesses make informed decisions, optimize inventory, and plan marketing strategies effectively. 
This project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Background
